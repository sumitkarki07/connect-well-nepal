# Health Resources Images

This directory should contain the following image files for the health articles:

## Required Images:
- `heart_health.jpg` - Image for heart health articles
- `dash_diet.jpg` - Image for DASH diet article
- `stress_management.jpg` - Image for stress management article
- `mindfulness.jpg` - Image for mindfulness meditation article
- `balanced_nutrition.jpg` - Image for nutrition article
- `exercise_routine.jpg` - Image for exercise routine article
- `vaccine_safety.jpg` - Image for vaccine safety article
- `covid_prevention.jpg` - Image for COVID prevention article

## Image Specifications:
- Format: JPG or PNG
- Recommended size: 400x200 pixels or larger (will be scaled)
- Aspect ratio: Approximately 2:1 (landscape)
- Content: Relevant to the article topic, professional/medical imagery

## Adding Images:
1. Place image files in this directory
2. Ensure filenames match exactly as listed above
3. Run `flutter pub get` if needed
4. Images will load automatically in the app

## Temporary Solution:
Until actual images are added, the app will show fallback icons for articles without images.
