## 🚀 Getting Started (For Each Member)

### **Step 1: Setup**
```bash
# Pull latest code
git pull origin main

# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Create your feature branch
git checkout -b feature/[your-name]-[feature]

# Example:
# git checkout -b feature/member1-appointments
```

### **Step 2: Run the App**
```bash
# Run on device/emulator
flutter run

# For hot reload during development, press 'r'
# For full restart, press 'R'
```

### **Step 3: Test User Roles**
- **Patient:** Sign up with "Patient" role selected
- **Doctor:** Sign up with "Doctor" role, fill professional info
- **Guest:** Use "Continue as Guest" button

### **Step 4: Development**
- Create your screens/services in the appropriate folders
- Follow existing patterns (check `doctor_dashboard_screen.dart` for reference)
- Use `context.watch<AppProvider>()` for reactive state
- Support dark mode using `Theme.of(context).brightness`

### **Step 5: Testing**
```bash
# Run tests
flutter test

# Check for errors
flutter analyze
```

### **Step 6: Merge**
- Create Pull Request
- Get code review from team
- Merge after approval

---

## 📞 Communication

**Group Chat:** [Your preferred platform]  
**Code Repository:** GitHub  
**Documentation:** This file + code comments  
**Issues:** Use GitHub Issues for bug tracking

---

## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Use Existing Patterns:** Check `doctor_dashboard_screen.dart` and `auth_screen.dart` for UI patterns
2. **Dark Mode:** Always test in both light and dark modes
3. **Role-Based Logic:** Use `appProvider.isPatient`, `appProvider.isDoctor` for conditional rendering
4. **Commit Often:** Small, meaningful commits
5. **Ask for Help:** Don't get stuck for hours
6. **Code Reviews:** Learn from each other's code
7. **Testing:** Test on real devices, not just emulator

---

## 📝 Key Code Patterns

### **Accessing User State:**
```dart
final appProvider = context.watch<AppProvider>();

// Check role
if (appProvider.isDoctor) {
  // Doctor-specific UI
}

// Get user info
final user = appProvider.currentUser;
print(user?.name);
print(user?.specialty);
```

### **Dark Mode Support:**
```dart
final isDark = Theme.of(context).brightness == Brightness.dark;

Container(
  color: isDark ? const Color(0xFF1E2A3A) : Colors.white,
  child: Text(
    'Hello',
    style: TextStyle(
      color: isDark ? Colors.white : AppColors.textPrimary,
    ),
  ),
)
```

### **Navigation:**
```dart
Navigator.push(
  context,
  MaterialPageRoute(builder: (_) => const YourScreen()),
);
```
